# Customer Acquisition Analysis
This README provides an overview of customer acquisition analysis using Python. The provided code involves various data visualization techniques to gain insights into customer acquisition cost (CAC), conversion rates, and marketing channels.

## Prerequisites
Before using the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scipy

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy
```

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading
The code starts by loading the customer acquisition dataset from a CSV file and displaying a summary of the dataset.

### Visualizing Marketing Channels
The code creates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of marketing channels.
This visualization provides insight into which channels are used most frequently for customer acquisition.
In this case, the Email Marketing channel has been the most effective channel and the referral channel has been the least effective.

### Normal Distribution Curve
A normal distribution curve is plotted based on the 'Marketing_Spend' data to understand its distribution.
The normal distribution curve and Student's t distribution curve, help understand the distribution of marketing spend. It allows you to identify whether marketing spend follows a normal or t-distribution, which can inform budgeting and decision-making. 
For this project, most of the Expenses are distributed around 2000 to 4000, and have only few outliers outside this range. so it's only logical that the budget is centered within this range.

### Student's t Distribution Curve
The code repeats the process for a Student's t distribution curve.

### Histogram of New Customers
A histogram is created to visualize the distribution of new customers. The histogram of new customers illustrates the distribution of new customers. This can help you identify patterns in customer acquisition and understand whether there are any outliers.

### Calculating Metrics
The code calculates three metrics: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), Conversion Rate, and Breakeven Customers.


## Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between new customers and CAC, with data points color-coded by marketing channel

# CAC Analysis
The Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) helps in understanding the relationship between the number of new customers and the cost associated with acquiring them. It allows you to analyze the efficiency of customer acquisition strategies and identify any outliers or trends.

The downward projection of the regression line indicates the reduction in Customer acquisition cost as the number of new customers increases. Meaning the business tends to spend less as they acquire more customers.


## Bar Plots
Bar plots are created to visualize the conversion rate and breakeven customers by marketing channel.

# Conversion Rate Analysis
The Conversion rates by marketing channel show which channels are the most effective in terms of converting marketing spend into new customers. This insight can guide marketing strategy decisions.

In this case, Online ads has been the most effective channel, although the others are not too far behind, this helps in the decision making and budget allocation processs.

## Comparison Plot
A comparison plot is created to visualize breakeven customers and new customers by marketing channel.

The comparison plot shows the relationship between breakeven customers and new customers by marketing channel. It helps in understanding which channels are most cost-effective in terms of achieving breakeven.

# Breakeven Customers
The Breakeven customers by marketing channel show how many customers need to be acquired to cover the marketing spend. This can inform decision-making about budget allocation and the sustainability of marketing strategies.


### Marketing Spend vs. CAC
Finally, a scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between marketing spend and CAC, color-coded by marketing channel.

The scatter plot of marketing spend vs. CAC, color-coded by marketing channel, helps understand the relationship between marketing spend and the associated customer acquisition cost. It can provide insights into cost-efficiency across different channels.

## Running the Code

To run this code, ensure you have the necessary data in the 'customer_acquisition_cost_dataset.csv' file and have the required libraries installed. You can execute the code in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook to perform the customer acquisition analysis.

Feel free to customize the code and visualizations to suit your specific dataset and analysis needs.
